# Fragments Microservice

## Project Overview

Fragments Microservices is a cloud-native microservice-based application designed to store, retrieve, and manage user-generated content (fragments) such as text, JSON, and binary data (e.g., images). The application is built using Node.js , Express.js, and deployed on AWS services for scalability and security.

The system allows users to perform basic CRUD operations on their fragments, with authentication and authorization handled via Amazon Cognito. Data is stored in AWS DynamoDB for metadata and Amazon S3 for binary content.
